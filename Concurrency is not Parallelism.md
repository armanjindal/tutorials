- [Concurrency is not Parallelism](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oV9rvDllKEg) - By Rob Pike
    - Based on current programming languages think the world is Object Oriented
    - Concurrency - way to build things, the composition of interacting processes
    - Paralellism - the **simultaneous execution** of multiple things   
    - C is a way of dealing with a lot of things at one and P is doing a lot of things at once. 
    - Concurrency is a way to structure something (which might lend itself to be executed in parallel but not necessarily) 
        - [[Reading List]] - Comunicating sequential Processes 
    - The concurrent composition of well managed pieces runs faster - adding another worker made the program execute faster. 
    - Independent features
