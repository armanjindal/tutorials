**AsyncIO?**
---
- Python library used to write concurrent code 
- **Concurrent** programs can run means it could run at the same time but not necessarily
	- Work using **async/await** syntax
- Used for I/O bound and high-level structured network code. 
- For CPU bound use the *multiprocesing* library 

- Allows code to fire multiple requests into EVENT-LOOP, block a specific function (called a coroutine) untill the I/O request is completed, then tells Python 

Generators - something in Python that creates a sequence of values
	- list(generator) - exhuasts the generator by calling next on it untill it is exhuasted and puts it into a list. 

Co-routines - Similar to generators as both can be used to stoped/pause executetion. Co-routines **consume** data while generators produce them. 

Await - used prior to async operations. Like break points which pause execution of following code (in the scope) untill the asynchronous call has been returned. 

Event Loop - Core of an async app. Run async tasks, callbacks and  I/Os 

Aynchronous Generators: 
	- When you are making a series of calls to databases/APIs and you do not know how long it is going to take. You want to service them and process the data ASAP. 

Def CallBack -  a callback is a function that gets passed into another function as an argument where itâ€™s executed when the parent function wants it to be executed. Immediatley in the case of synchronous function and whenever in an async one.
