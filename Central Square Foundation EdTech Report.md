Context - EdTech largley aimed at urban and middle to high income segments. Aim to examine existing solutions in the EdTech space aimed at **low income individuals** 

Key terms - instructional aids ("blended" to help teachers teach), individual use (aimed at students directly), personalized adaptive products (PAL) a subset of individual use. 

Exec. Summary - regional language, cultural context, cheap, range of learning level. Need to demonstrate effectivness to local decison makers, and guidance and support in deploying EdTech.  

Findings Evidence - hardware/time of use does NOT imply improvement, need clear evidence, after school intervention, interventions on Math most effective > language, and ones which are adaptive to current learning levels. 

Findings Product - No single product dominance (fragmented use) - although BYJU a big player, focused on instructional videos and animation, 

Home Based Educational - Market 511 crore (2017) expected to grow 60% year on year. 

Hardware - Less than 20% of schools have computer labs or hardware for individual-use products. Slightly more than 20% of Indians own smartphones. RAPIDLY CHANGING

---
Evidence for EdTech:

- Found interventions which actually had negative effects. 
- Provision of hardware in the absence of training (especially for teachers)
- Evidence favoring individual based learning
- Effects of EdTech maximized in under-resourced schools where the additional tool makes more difference 
- Huge importance of adaptive technology


Evaluation Metrics:
1. Product Design

- Recommendation: In addition to selecting products based on type and features, use targeted evaluation methodologies at various stages of roll-out to ensure the product is meeting its intended objective

- Recommendation: Instructional aid products should have high-quality explanation videos as products are mostly used to show these videos.
	- "Use of videos was also high in individual-use products" (but Questions & Tests were close seconds.)
- Recommendation: If interactive features are an important component of the pedagogical strategy to improve learning, individual-use products should actively steer users towards these features.
- Recommendation: Instructional aids should provide lesson plans that are thorough, flexible, and make integration of the product with standard classroom practices easy."

2. Content:


- Most Hindi content is low quality. 
- Recommendation: Vernacular-language learning products should incorporate quality pedagogical practices and use more engaging content than merely passages of textbooks read aloud.
- Recommendation: Features and content should be clearly and accurately mapped to the school curriculum. The product navigation and content structure should enable users to easily integrate the products into regular instruction practices."
	-  "Poor carriculum mapping (Poor curriculum mapping (organising and labelling content by how it fits with the syllabus) was a major barrier to consistent use" (pg. 26)
- Recommendation: Products should provide comprehensive coverage of all target subjects.

3. Delivery
 
 - Language as a barrier to communicate. Primary students most effectivley taught in native language (Ferguesson, 2013). Use native language content and interface.
- "Recommendation: Instructional language should be accessible to a wide range of capability levels. Products should minimize the need to follow written instructions, especially for younger grades. They should use simple interfaces, little text, and audio cues."

4. Adaptivity:
- Teachers/students  use content from multiple grades within a single class. 
- "Recommendation: Products should allow students and teachers to access content across a wide range of difficulties and grade levels for all product types."
- Definitons:
	1. Within topic (difficulty adaptivity) - vary questions/content based on students performance **in the topic** 
	2. Across-topic adaptivity - determine topic to study based on ongoing in-app performance
- "Recommendation: Individual-use products should use tools to match instruction levels with student capability."

5. Use of Data

- Across platforms incredibly poor. Investigators could not use the data to track overall student learning level. 
- Recommendation: Products should build in credible assessments of learning gains over time.
- Complicated data dashboards often not used by teachers. They need to be made more simple and actionable. 


Identified Market Gaps:
- High quality instruction in non English language
- Targetted intructions
- Home use products for low and medium income households. Average pri9ceprice of top funded projects on the market is 20K/year. Far too expensive for most. 

Implementation:
- Rapid and focussed evaluation soon after deployment. Emphasize on the ground use. Sleek and complicated features often went unused by users. Try to automate this evalution from backend, and to largest extent possible prevent the gamification of the metrics. 
	- The evaluator should use general student opinions about learning and engagement cautiously.Student interviews should focus on how students interact with the productâ€™s features.
