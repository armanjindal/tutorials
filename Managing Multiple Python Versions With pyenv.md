- Pyenv is a tool used for managing multiple Python Versions. Even if you have Python already downloaded onto the system. 
- Why not use that? Mainly for the OS. All packages get installed at a system level. 
- Pyenv lets you:
	-  Install Python in your user space
	-  Install multiple versions of Python
	-  Specify the exact Python version you want
	-  Switch between the installed versions


- pyenv-virtualenv <python_version> <project_name> - creates a virtual environment AND python environment in one command. 
-pyenv local <project_name> activates the virtual environment.
