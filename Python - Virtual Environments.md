- Installing packages with pip installs the package in a **global** context
	- What if two different projects need different versions of packages or even of Python?
- Answer is **virtualenvs**
- Once the environment is **activiated** you see the environment in () on the left. Any packages installed then are added to the venv - NOT THE GLOBAL 
- All packages are then installed into this "environment" 
- Can access and virtualenv using **workon** (NAME_OF_VENV)
