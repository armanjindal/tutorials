Part 1: 
- Embedding a personality is a normal part of developing a chat bot
- ELIZA - historical bot which used regex matching with pronoun switching togive the impression of intelligent conversation, but not really.

- NLU (Natural Language Understanding) is a subfield of Natural Language Processsing (NLP), concerned with intents and entities. 
	- intents - what is the user trying to do?
	- entities - what are the details (names/dates/locations) inside the statement
- Word Vectors - using ML for intent. 
	- Can use individual characters, fragments, and sentece. 
	- Using SpaCy - trained on the Glove Algoithm:
		- What matters is how similar the vectors are - done using the cosine similarity. Sklearn has a module for this.
- Word Vectors can now be used to do supervised learning to recognize intents. 
	- Can use Nearest Neighbour - but better to Support Vector Machine for intent recognition
	- Train the classifier by using many sentences - put into word vector formats, then map them to numbers which correspond to intents
- This approach does not work for entity recogntion. Need to find context clues to identitfy generic entites
	- Better to use pre-built to do entity extraction from spaCy (if it is generic)
	- Different entities can play different roles 
	- A parse tree is a hierachical structure which indpendent of word order buids relations between prepository words 
	- Using spCy when you find a color or any other description of an entity can trace it back to what it is describing with the ancestor functionality. 


Rasa NLU
- High level API for intent recogniton and entity extraction:
	- Built on top of spaCy, scikit-learn, and other libraries.
	- With support for chatbot specific tasks
- Provide training data in a JSON format:
- A piece of training data - includes text, intent, entities -> learns how to extract this from the text
- Use RASA NLU through an **interpretor** object in python - which is trained on the data. 
- RASA Pipeline -> Puts into a piepline all the steps we did:
	- 1. Turn into a nlp doc
	- 2. Map synonyms 
	- 3. Turn into vecotrized word 
	- 4. Classifier
- RASA Config is a way for you to 
- Conditional Random Fields (crf) - a ML model used that works well for named entity recogniton even on a small training data set 
- **Handling Typo**s - Rasa intent_featurizer_ngram - breaks the word into key parts

Virtual Assistant & Interacting with Data:

- SQL common database querying language, but also used for APIs
- Python has SQLite3
- Be careful of SQL Injection (an attack where a user can gain access to the whole database).
	- In order to do safely, pass in params as a tuple into the execute function 
- Make connection with sqlite3.connect, access a cursor, use .execute on the cursor to query the database, use .fetchall to see what is inside the cursor. 
- Exploring a database with NLP - turining messages into database queries using strings. Not always the best way but it is the most general. 


- Filtering slots:
	- Basic memory - save parameters in the dictionary. But when to wipe the memory is tricky
- Negation - a tricky topic in NLP 
	- use aa



Stateful Bots: 
- For more sophisticated bots need to add states. Means the bot has a memory.
- State Machine:
	- Eg. a traffic light. Remebers the previous state they were in. 
	- Multi-step process. 
- Excercise to build a coffee ordering concierge. 
	- To represent different states often use INTs then use a entities to move the user from one state to another. 
- Must have a global scope (outside of respond and send_message function) - this state variable will be overwritten through the send message functionality.
