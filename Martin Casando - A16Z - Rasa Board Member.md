- Blog Post [The Empty Promise of Data Moats](https://a16z.com/2019/05/09/data-network-effects-moats/) - By: Martin Casado and Peter Laute
	- Data network effects (lots of data) often thought of as a "moat" for AI startups
		- A protection from competition/competitive advantage over others. 
	- Is this really true? Particularly for "enterprise AI"
		- No! Data + network effects ≠ data network effects
			- Def: Enterprise AI = Enterprise software made using AI 
			- Sub Def: Enterprise Software - "also known as enterprise application software (EAS), is computer software used to satisfy the needs of an organization rather than individual users" [^1]

	- Why is answering this question important? 
	> Treating data as a magical moat can misdirect founders from focusing on 	what’s really needed to win
	- Key Terms:
		- Network - group of people organized around a technology 
		- Network *effects* - "occur when the value of participating in a network goes up for the participants as more nodes come on to the network, or as engagement increases between existing nodes."
	- System with network effects often have the property of "direct interaction" between the nodes with defined protocol (adherence to some standard). Data Network Effects often does not have this property. 
	- BUT it can HELP. I.e better recommendation algorithm drives engagement. Casando claims that it isn't strong enough (as it is enough made out to be)
		- Counter example - TikTok - users love "the algorithm"
	- Casando - It can also HURT - "Instead of getting stronger, the data moat erodes as the corpus grows" - eg. with intent coverage of the chat bot. 
 	- Understanding Data:
		- Minimum Viable Corpus - a needed step, but can often be aquired cheaply therefore not a moat. 
		- Data Acquisition Costs - UNLIKE normal network effects where user acquisition costs go down with network size (people bring in other people), the cost of data integration (cleaning into the corpus) goes UP with as "data network" increases. Utility also diminishes as the additional data is often edge case as opposed to early data which applied to the whole customer base. 
			- Counter Example: RasaX is trying to solve this problem precisely.
		- Boot strap initial corpus to compete:	
			- Can generate "the right kind" of synthetic data to out compete those who have been in the game longer and are relying on a worse (but larger) data moat.
		- Value of Data (Y - Axis), Amount(X - axis) - Data Value Distribution
			- **How**does play in the solution? This varies with domain.
			- What error rates are acceptable?
			- How does data improve (or harm) your product?
			- Quality v quantity? Optimizing quality might make a generally good product across many areas but not great in any one area. \
		- Proprietary Data Sources:
			- This *kind of data* often leads to good 
	- Key Take Always:
		- (More) data in itself for AI companies is not a panacea (a cure-all) 
		- The "moats" they **often create** are not as robust as you think
		- If not planned correctly can even have a detrimental effect. 
		- Start ups must think more holistically about defensibility
	
	> Instead, we encourage startups to think more holistically about defensibility. Greater long-term defensibility is more likely to come from packaging differentiated technology; understanding the domain and reflecting that in your product as you verticalize across industries; dominating the go-to-market race; and winning the talent war to build a world-class team. These efforts will pay off in defending and winning in the markets far more than data alone.
