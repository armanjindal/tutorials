# tutorials
Steal like an artist and give credit like an academic. Tutorials I distill and on topics I teach.
A project inspired by my compulsive consumption of coding tutorials, conviction I can learn to code without college and passion to help others do the same.
Also motivated by my own selfishness of the wisdom encompassed in the Feynmann method. Credit given at all places.
Early notes right now. Will turn into more fleshed out, notes to be hosted on my github.io
Woking with college profs to open source their classes. This is first priority.
