# tutorials
Steal like an artist and give credit like an academic. Tutorials I distill and on topics I teach. A project inspired by my compulsive consumption of coding tutorials, conviction I can learn to code without college and help others do the same, and the selfishness of the wisdom encompassed in the Feynmann method. Credit given at all places.
